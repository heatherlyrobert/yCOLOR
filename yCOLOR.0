.SH NAME
.B yCOLOR
\- predictably aesthetic color palettes and transformations

.SH DESCRIPTION (short)
yCOLOR is a heatherly library for maintaining, generating, and supplying
consistenly aesthetic and professional color palettes for a myriad of end-uses
including both programs and end-users.

.SH DECISION PROCESS

.B situation (s).  
nearly every program requires the use of color to highlight, differentiate,
inform, group, categorize, and focus end-users.  professional colors are a
critical part of user acceptance.

.B complication (c).  
for the non-artist, this is a difficult, tedious, unreliable task with a almost
trivial chance of success.  it is important and it is nearly impossible to
do right -- awesome.

.B problem statement (p).  
this is important for my future as it allows faster and more reliable intake
of data and analysis.  how do i create a method of generating color palettes
to use across all my programs.

.B answer (a).  
i will take some of the best designed color schemes and also the best thinking
on generating new color palettes and put it into once place so i can experiment
quickly with relaible results.

.B objectives (o).  
   -- large set of publicly available color schemes ready for use
   -- specialty color schemes for large data set visualization
   -- fully testing and accurate kinematics using opengl as the benchmark
   -- expansive spider movement scripting meta-language
   -- predict servo positioning issues without real-life experimentation
   -- controlled using completely standard vi-keys (zero mouse/touch)
